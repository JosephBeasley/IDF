# Linux Setup

For the 2018-2 IQT course, we will be using Fedora  \(we have two different "spins": Gnome and LXDE\). Fedora is based off of Red Hat Linux \(Though more up to date for development purposes\) and utilizes it's RPM/DNF package manager. In fact, Red Hat is the sponsor for Fedora. We choose Fedora due to it's easy to use package manager, great development tools and stability within the VM enviroment.  

## Setting up Fedora
