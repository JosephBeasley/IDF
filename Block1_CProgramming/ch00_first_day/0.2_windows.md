# Windows Setup

This may be hard to believe, but setting up software on Windows is actually more challenging than Fedora. I can not give you a script and snapshots are unreliable. The instructors have flashed all of the laptops, so everything should be good. So instead of going through how to install each program, we are just going to verify all software.

## Software

1. Click Windows button
2. Type in "visual studio" and Visual Studio Community 2017 should pop up.
