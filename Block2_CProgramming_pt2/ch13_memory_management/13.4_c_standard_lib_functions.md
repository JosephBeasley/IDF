# C standard library functions

```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
/* malloc() allocates size bytes and returns a pointer
   to the allocated memory. The memory is not initialized. */

void free(void *ptr);
/* free() frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must
   have been returned by a previous call to malloc(), calloc() 
   or realloc(). */

void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
/* calloc() allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of
   size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
   The memory is set to zero. */

void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
/* realloc() changes the size of the memory block pointed to by
   ptr to size bytes. */
```
## POP QUIZ

1. Does free() delete your information?
2. Does realloc() always return a different memory address?
3. When realloc() returns a different memory address, is the original content…
    1. …Zeroized?
    2. …Freed?
4. Should we zeroize a pointer variable that’s been freed?
