# Debugging with Visual Studio

In this lesson, we are going to quickly go over how to debug with Visual Studio. This lesson piggybacks off of the CLion debugging lesson. It's a shortened version of it. So please, ensure you go through the CLion lesson before proceeding to this one. This lesson assumes that you have a basic understanding of debugging terms. 

## The "Program" we are going to debug:

This is the same example we went over in CLion. That way you can make comparrisons in the way these two IDEs work. 

`main.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

int square(int a);


int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    int a = 10;
    char x[] = {"This is a string"};
    int sqNum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= strlen(x); i++) {
        printf("%c", x[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    printf("===========\n");
    printf("Enter a number that you'd like to find the sqrt of:");
    scanf("%d", sqNum);
    printf("The square root of %d is %d\n", sqNum, square(sqNum));

    return 0;
}


int square(int a) {
    return sqrt(a);
}
```

We do not have any other files. A CMake file isn't needed, since Visual Studio keeps track of built properities for you. 

### Running the Program

Unlike CLion, Visual Studio will not allow us to run this program. Instead we are greeted with a message:

![](/assets/vs_error.PNG)

If we click yes, the project will build. The executable will be produced. But it will not run. If we click no, we will be given the errors right off of the back. Let's click no. 

![](/assets/vs_error_list.PNG)

Let's let at the first error. An error will have a `red x` graphic next to it. Whereas a warning will have a `yellow !` graphic. 

The warning says;

`'scanf': This function or variable may be unsafe. Consider using scanf_s instead. To disable deprecation, use _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS.`

Visual Studio build tool requires some C functionality to have _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS to be defined. Functionality such as scanf. Sure, it's dangrous. But if used correctly it's fine. C in itself is a "dangrous" language. So let's define that at the top of our file. Add,

`#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS 1` to the top of our file (all the way at the top). There is also an offical way to do this that will work at the pre-processor level. Feel free to look it up or wait until we cover the preprocessor. 

Once you have done that, run the program again. A console window should pop up. 

![](/assets/vs_output1.PNG)

Okay, now our program is building and the executable is runnable. 

## Breakpoints

We create breakpoints in Visual Studio the exact same way we do in CLion. Let's put a breakpoint on `line 15`

![](/assets/vs_breakpoint.PNG)

## Running in Debugging Mode

Next, we are going to engage debugging mode. This is done by ensuring the type of build is debug and clicking the build+run button. Refer to 04.0 for how the toolbar should look. 

Just like CLion, some windows will pop up.

* First our console
* As well as two snapped windows. 
  * Autos
    * This window is like the CLion debug window
  * Error List
    * This window is pretty awesome. It will show all warning and errors that it finds. Regardless of it the program executed or not. As you can see, we have 3 warnings. 

![](/assets/vs_debug_win1.PNG)
![](/assets/vs_debug_win2.PNG)

Just like with CLion, we can expand arrays. 

![](/assets/vs_string.PNG)

### Stepping Through the Program

Stepping in Visual Studio is very similar to CLion. The toolbar to perform this is near the build+run toolbar. You can also use shortcuts or the dropdown menu. 

![](/assets/vs_step.PNG)

#### TODO

Try stepping through the program just like you would with CLion. 

## Adding to Watch

Adding to watch is very similar to CLion. Just right click and add to watch. Navigating your windows is slightly different though. 

![](/assets/vs_watch.PNG)

Take a look at the bottom of the screenshot above. Notice the three tabs? 

* `Locals` window shows variables defined in the local scope
* `Autos` window shows variables used around the current breakpoint
* `Watch 1` are like CLion watches. Except that you can easily add additonal watch tabs. 

## Evaluating Expressions (Quick Watch)

This also works very similarly to CLion. But instead of choosing `Evalue Expression`, you would click `Quick Watch...`. 

![](/assets/vs_quick_watch.PNG)

This tool functions exactly the same as CLion. You can cater your expression any way you wish. You can also add it to watch once you have it the way you want it. Or, you can just right click the expression and add it straight to watch. 

## Changing Values

Changing Values is a tad easier in Visual Studio. Just like with CLion, you will be paying attention to the autos/local/watch window. Double clicking the variables current value will allow you to change that value. That's it. 

# Additional Visual Studio Tools

We stopped short on CLion. Not because it doesn't have additional tools, but because we aren't focused as heavily on those tools. Using GDB out right is sometimes quicker than loading up an IDE for instance. Not to mention, CLion isn't our area of focus for this course. At least not yet. 

## Peaking/Go to Definitions

Let's assume we are working on a huge C Project. You imported a header full of functions that we are going to utilize in this current file. But you have no idea what they do. Luckily for you, Visual Studio allows us to peak the definition of said function... or even go to it if we please. 

To do so, right click said function and click `Peak Definition`

![](/assets/vs_peak.PNG)

You will also see, on the far right side, the file in which the definition is located. In this case, it's just `main.c`. 

There are many other things we can do by right clicking a function. 

![](/assets/vs_right_click.PNG)

* Go To Definition: This will bring us to the definitions file and location
* Go to Declaration: This will bring us to the declarations file and location
* Find All References will display all references to said function
* Rename: This will refactor the name of the function across all files
* Go to Disassembly
  * This will bring us to the disassembly of said function, line, etc. (more to come on this)
  * We will be using this often in the Windows ASM section
  * There are multiple windows associated with this. Many will be listed below.

## Additional Windows

![](/assets/vs_debug_windows.PNG)

* Breakpoints
  * This window will display all breakpoints and their locations
* Call Stack
  * This window will display the call stack in its current layout
* Registers
  * This window will display the ASM registers and their current values
* Memory
  * This dropdown will give you the different setups of memory. You can configure their data size output and view whats currently in memory. 

![](/assets/vs_stats.PNG)

This window will appear while debugging... on the right hand side. This is a quick snapshot of how much resources your program is using. It's useful for detecting memory leaks and performance of your program. 

# Conclusion

Again, this is not everything you can do in Visual Studio. There are so many tools you can explorer. Feel free to do so!
