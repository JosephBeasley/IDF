# Debugging with CLion

In this lesson, we are going to quickly go over how to debug with CLion. There is no way we could cover every little thing you can do with the CLion debugger or every single error and how to debug it. Instead, we are going to teach you how to use the debugger so that you can apply it and figure out how to debug a variety of errors as you go. 

On Linux, the CLion debugger should take use of GDB for debugging.

## The "Program" we are going to debug:

Below is the program we are doing to debug. It's not much of a program... just a bunch of random things thrown together. The program does contain a few bugs that we are going to work out along the way. 

`main.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

int square(int a);


int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    int a = 10;
    char x[] = {"This is a string"};
    int sqNum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < a; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i <= strlen(x); i++) {
        printf("%c", x[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    printf("===========\n");
    printf("Enter a number that you'd like to find the sqrt of:");
    scanf("%d", sqNum);
    printf("The square root of %d is %d\n", sqNum, square(sqNum));

    return 0;
}


int square(int a) {
    return sqrt(a);
}
```

`CMakeLists.txt`

This is included because the math library needed to be included. This is how we did it:

```c
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
project(debug_demo C)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)

add_executable(debug_demo main.c)

target_link_libraries(debug_demo m)
```

### Running the program

This is our output:

```
Hello, World!
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
This is a string[] 
===========
Enter a number that you'd like to find the sqrt of:10

Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)
```

* So it doesn't appear we count all the way to 10
* There is some garbage character printing after string
* We get a segfault after inputing our number

## Breakpoints

Let's tackle the first issue. We know that takes place during our for loop. So let's place a break point on `line 15` and monitor what the values do. To do that, we just click to the right of line 15. A red circle will appear. 

![](/assets/clion_breakpoint.png)

## Running in Debugging Mode

Next, we are going to engage debugging mode. To do this, click the bug symbol on the run toolbar. 

![](/assets/run_bar.png)

A new window will appear. This is called the debug window:

![](/assets/debug_window.png)

As you can see if you're following along, the program was built and ran to lan 15 where it stoped. 

* If we hop down to the debug window, we can see that it has captured the variables and their vlaues that of been declared and ititialized. We can click on the arrow next to the string to see all of it's values per index. 

![](/assets/clion_string.png)

* As you can see, it displays everything... including the nul-terminator. 
* This list will continue to get updated as we step through the program. 
* Speaking of which...

### Stepping Through the Program

Now that we are on line 15, we want to see what happens to the values during the for loop. To step, there are a few handy buttons located in the top left of the debugging window. 

![](/assets/clion_stepping.png)

* The blue arrow that goes up, then down is our `step over` button.
    * Stepping over means to step over a loop, condition or function call. 
* The blue arrow that goes down is our `step into` button
    * Stepping into will step into a loop, condition or function call. 
* The red arrow that goes down is a `force step into` button
    * Force step will do as it says. This is used if you want to step into a system function or something similar. Do note, if you don't have the source code... it'll display disassembly. 
* The blue arrow going up is a `step out of` button
    * Step out of will exit something you stepped into. So if you got tired of looping after stepping into... you can step out. 
* The blue arrow pointing to the cursor will run the program to where your cursor is currently clicked
* The calculator button will Evaluate Expression
    * More on this later

So let's continue and step into our for loop. We are going to continue to step in until we notice something weird of unexpected with the values in the debugging window. Our code window will display some information too. Below is a screenshot of us having stepped in 6 times... thus i is 5. Notice how it displays the itteration for us. This makes it slightly easier to know how many times you stepped in without having to look at the debug window. 

![](/assets/clion_step5.png)

Based off of our output, we can use common sense and determine we need to step to the end. 

As we have noticed during stepping... this is the last thing we saw before we exited the for loop. 

![](/assets/clion_step9.png)

This can only lead us to one conclusion. We aren't counting high enough. The solution to this would be to count one more. We can do this by changing `i < a` to `i <= a`. 

After you have made the change, try running the program normally. The output should now be 1-10. 

Step through the next issue and see if you can determine the problem. Then fix it! (I know, the problem is pretty straight forward. But step through it anyways... watch what happens to the values.)

Repeat with the scanf. What happens to the values? Are we core dumping before anything happens? If so, what do we do?

## Adding to Watch

IDEs also come with a great features that allow you to monitor a value or expression by adding it to the watch. To do so, just right click a variable and click `Add to Watches`. After you have added a variable to a watch, you can see it below in your debugging window. If you do not, look for the glasses icon in the debugging window and click that. Your watch window will then appear. 

![](/assets/var_watch.png)

Adding items to your watches does more than what the variables window does. Watches will always be displayed. No matter the file, function or state of your variable or expression (more to come). You can see it's status at all times... which can be helpful if you believe something else is effecting it at some point in the program. 

## Evaluating Expressions

One of CLion's most powerful tool is evaluating expressions ahead of time. Or using custom values. Right click on an expression (a function for example) and click `Evaluate Expression`. 

![](/assets/clion_eval.png)

In my example, I evaluated `square()` and replaced it's default parameter with 20. Then I hit evaluate and the result was given below. 

We can go a step further and add this Expression Evaluation to the watch list. Right click it, just as you would a variable. And click `Add to Watches`. Now you can see your expression and what it would evaluate too based off the information provided. 

![](/assets/eval_watch.png)

Due to where I watched the expression in the program, the value is still 0. Now, if we stepped beyond the scanf and inputed a value, the evaulation would change. But we can also take this a step further. 

## Changing Values

What if we were curious what would happen, in a certain part of the program, if a variable's value were something different. What if sqNum was set at some point before the scanf was ran. What would the evaluation be?

Well, luckily we have that functionality. 

In the example below, I stepped to line 15. So at this point, SqNum was set to 0. What would happen if we set it to 10? To do this, without changing your code, right click SqNum in the variables debugging window and click `Set Value...`. Let's change it to 10. 

![](/assets/set_val.png)

Notice, sqNum was set to 10. The watch evaluation also updated. All of this happened before we even set sqNum. This can be very useful in some scenarios. 

# Conclusion

There are many other debugging features we could go over. But these are the basics. Feel free to experiment and look up other useful tools and functionality of the CLion debugger!
